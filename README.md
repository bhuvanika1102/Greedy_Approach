# Greedy Approach Problems

Welcome to the Greedy Approach Problems repository! This repository contains various examples of problems and solutions that utilize the greedy algorithm approach.

## Overview

The greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit. It is used for optimization problems where local optimization leads to a global optimum.

This repository includes implementations of different greedy approach problems, which demonstrate how this approach can be applied to solve complex problems efficiently.

## Problems Included
1. **Lemonade Change Problem**: Determine if you can provide the correct change to customers, given their payment amounts and your available denominations.
2. **Frog Jump Problem**: Calculate the minimum cost required for a frog to jump across stones, where each stone has a specific cost.
3. **Assign Cookies Problem**: Maximize the number of children who can be content with a limited number of cookies, where each cookie has a different size.
4. **Insert Interval Problem**: Insert a new interval into a set of non-overlapping intervals, merging overlapping intervals as necessary.
5. **CPU Scheduling Problem**: Optimize the order of processes in a CPU scheduling queue to minimize the total waiting time or maximize CPU utilization.
